# Image Recognition Using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for building an image recognition system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can classify images into different categories. This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques for image recognition.

## Datasets

The project uses the following datasets:
- [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/): A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-recognition-ml.git
cd image-recognition-ml
```

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing script to resize and normalize the images:
```python
# Preprocessing is done within the script, no separate script needed.
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.mnist.load_data()
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255
test_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255
```

### Training

Train the model using the training script:
```python
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=64,
          validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
```

### Inference

Use the trained model to make predictions on new images:
```python
predictions = model.predict(test_images[:10])
for i in range(10):
    print(f"Prediction: {tf.argmax(predictions[i]).numpy()}, True Label: {test_labels[i]}")
```

## Model Training

The `train.py` script allows you to train the model from scratch or use transfer learning with a pre-trained model. Various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs can be specified.

Example command:
```python
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=64,
          validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model:
```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}')
```

The evaluation script calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The results of the training and evaluation are saved in the `results` directory. This includes model weights, training logs, and visualizations of the training process.
